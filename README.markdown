Idea
====
A experimental spider to search for websites starting from a specific site.
Connect it to public API's to get nice statistics about websites.


Todo
====
	[ ] Add count per site, when we found it again increase the number
	[ ] Create run script that forks the spider
	[ ] Connect to API's to get cool statistics
	[ ] Get real HTTP code
	[ ] Log memory usage and other stats
	[ ] Make it extremly fast! Use message queue's, caching and no overhead
	[X] Use a noSQL Database
